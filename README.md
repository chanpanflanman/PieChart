# PieChart

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Json-server: Install the json-server package (npm i json-server), then create a custom db that you can host via cli 
(npm json-server --watch your_database_name.json -p 3000)

In my case, the API service in this project reads from 'info' of the 'db.json' server, which also contains the array of data
that is utilized in the pie chart component.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
